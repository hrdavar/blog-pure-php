### ðŸ“Œ Technology Stack :

This application has been developed using pure PHP, without relying on any heavy frameworks. By choosing not to implement a framework, such as Laravel, the system remains lightweight and optimized for performance. While frameworks offer built-in features, they often come with overhead in terms of memory usage and processing power. This approach ensures a more efficient use of resources, ideal for applications where simplicity and speed are paramount.  
### ðŸ“Œ Current Database Tables (Version 1.0):  
| Table Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| users      |  |
